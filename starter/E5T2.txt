# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
Checkov (https://bridgecrew.io/blog/announcing-cloudformation-support-in-checkov/)
can be used to scan the Cloudformation/Terraform files for vulnerabilities. 
It is open source, and free.
### Example vulnerability
A security group that allowed Access from everywhere, rather than from
a specific/known source of addresses, and to specific ports.


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR) can perform static analysis of 
container images and find any Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
prior to deployment.

### Example vulnerability
A popular web application software that is used on your application 
(e.g. WordPress) is using library/plugin with a known vulnerability.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
AWS Inspector can be used to find vulnerabilities in deployed applications.
It can scan hosts for vulnerable software with an Inspector Agent
being installed on the instance.

### Example vulnerability

A WordPress plugin used by your EC2 Instance has become vulnerable to 
a privileged escalation attack since post-deployment.
