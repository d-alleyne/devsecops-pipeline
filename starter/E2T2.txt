Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark notes that the Security Group
WebAppSG allows SSH and RDP access from the internet. This can be
remedied by modifying the CloudFormation yaml file to prevent this
from happening, then re-released. As mentioned earlier, the Web Instance
should be configured to only accept web traffic from the load balancer.

AWS Config notes that the S3 buckets allow non-secure access, and the 
Application Load Balancer doesn't redirect HTTP to HTTPS. In short, 
our web application should be configured for SSL connections.

AWS Config notes that for remote access, our EC2 instances should be
configured to use AWS Systems Manager. Using AWS Systems Manager 
will provide us secure access to the EC2 instances without the
need for Access Keys, which can be compromised.
