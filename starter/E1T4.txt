Two poor security practices of the architecture:

1) Traffic from the Attack Simulation Instance is allowed to connect to the Web Service Instance. 
The Web Service Instance should be configured to only accept traffic from the Application Load Balancer.
Currently, the web service allows traffic from anywhere on port 22 and 5000. 

2) The Instance Role is too permissive. It allows all actions to S3 buckets. 
This means that if an EC2 instance is compromised, the contents of the S3 buckets are accessible.
The EC2 instance in the Untrusted subnet should have a different Instance Role that the 
Web Service EC2 instance.
