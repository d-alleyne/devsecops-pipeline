# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Instead of allowing access to port 5000 from any source within the ALB's subnet, we can reduce the attack surface by only allowing
access to port 5000 from instances with the ALB's security group. This will mitigate any attacks from instances within the ALB's subnet.
Also, a Web Application Firewall can be placed in front of the ALB (as suggested in Exercise 3) to prevent common attacks.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
According to the VPC Endpoint documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html, 
an S3 bucket policy can be used to restrict access to the bucket from from a specific endpoint, as well as specific users/principals.
In our current architecture, yes, it can be used to prevent unauthorized access to the secret bucket from instances within
the public subnets.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Enabling S3 bucket encryption encrypts new content. Existing content remains unencrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Applying the original cloud formation templates to this environment would revert all of the 
measures that we used to harden the environment from security threats.
