# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
The following changes can be made to the environment to prevent SSH brute force attacks:
1) The security group of Web Server Instance should be limited to accept traffic from the
Application Load Balancer
2) A Network Address Control List rule can used to deny SSH traffic between subnets


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
The Instance Role can be modified so that it only allows Read Access to the free recipes
bucket, and an explicit deny to the secret recipes bucket.
