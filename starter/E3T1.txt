# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty found 2 'UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce' attacks. 
The first finding, with the blue circle, refers the EC2 Instance "Web Service Instance - C3" 
which is being attacked. The second finding, with the red triangle, refers to the EC2 Instance 
"Attack Instance - C3" which is performing the attack.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to the GuardDuty documentation:
"AWS Guard Duty sources its information from Cloud Trail events and VPC Flow Logs. VPC
Flow Logs contain information about IP traffic that exits and enters network intefaces
in our VPC. The documentation states: "It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists
of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and
potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment.". In our case, 
I believed it used machine learning when analyzing the VPC logs and found traces of traffic
that looks like an SSH BruteForce attack.
